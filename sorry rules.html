<h1>Setup
    Each player takes three pawns of one color and places them on their matching color start area. Shuffle the cards and place them face down in the center of the board.

    The youngest player goes first. Play passes to the left.Two pawns of the same color are not premised to occupy the same space. If your move gives you no option other than landing on a space you already occupy, you lose your turn.
    Pawns may also move backward if a 4 or a 10 card is drawn. If your pawn has been moved at least 2 spaces behind your START, on your following turn you can move into your SAFETY ZONE without having to move across the board.

    If you land exactly on a space with a triangle, no matter which card you drew, you can slide along the marked spaces until the end. You may only slide on triangles that are not your own color. While sliding you may also bump pawns in your path back to their start. If you land on a triangle of your own color- do not slide, just stay on the triangle.

    *Note:

    You must always move if you can, even if it puts you at a disadvantage.
    If the Draw Pile runs dry, shuffle the Discard Pile and reuse it.
    Safety Zone
    Safety Zones resemble slide zones but are larger, at the end of which is HOME. You can only enter the Safety Zone which corresponds to the color of your pawns/START space. Normal rules apply within the Safety Zone. You may not enter the Safety Zone through a direct backward move, however, you can move backward out of the Safety Zone if the card instructs. That pawn has the opportunity to move back into the zone on the following turn.

    Winning the Game
    Be the first player to get all four of their pawns to their color corresponding HOME space to win. If you wish to play again, the winner may have first turn.

    Card Values
    1: Starting card, move one of your pawns one space forward.</h1>
